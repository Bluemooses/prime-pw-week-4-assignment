# Prework Week 4

Welcome to the week four homework assignment. You have learned a lot over this week, it's impressive. Take a look at the topics listed below and be proud of yourself!

## Topics Covered
* Array Review
* Multi-Dimensional Arrays
* Heterogeneous Arrays
* Jagged Arrays
* Object Literals
* Object Constructors (Basic)
* Object Properties
* Object Methods
* `this` (in relation to Objects)
* Object Constructors (Advanced)
* Bringing it all together (Loops, Objects, and Arrays)

## Assignment
As always start off by forking and cloning this repository from Github. Open the code in Atom to get started.

**IMPORTANT:** Don't forget to _keep the existing code as is_ and ignore any code that is commented: `// -- DON'T TOUCH CODE BELOW --`.

Finally, remember `console.log()` is your friend and you can use it in conjunction with the browser console to see the output of your code as you go.

### Files Provided

This week you'll be completing the scripts in the following files:

- [ ] *1_arrayLoopAndConcat.js*
- [ ] *2_arrayReverser.js*
- [ ] *3_objectLiteralCreate.js*
- [ ] *4_objectLiteralFix.js*
- [ ] *5_objectConstructorCreate.js*

Similar to last week's assignment, each script has some code ready for you with comments telling you what to write. Take the following as an example.

It may have originally been assigned like this:

```javascript
function tripleThis( number ){
  // this function accepts a number as an argument
  // write code that triples the number given
  // return this new, higher number
} // end tripleThis
```

After doing your work, it might look something like the following:

```javascript
function tripleThis( number ){
  // this function accepts a number as an argument
  // write code that triples the number given
  var answer = number * 3;
  // return this new, higher number
  return answer;
} // end tripleThis
```

### Assignment Submission
Check in your repo, then turn in your work via the Prime Academy Assignment Application at http://primeacademy.io, as usual and don't hesitate to hit up the Slack channel as needed!
