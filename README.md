# Prework Week 4

Welcome to the week four homework assignment. You have learned a lot over this week, it's impressive. Take a look at the topics listed below and be proud of yourself!

## Topics Covered in Codecademy
* Array Review
* Multi-Dimensional Arrays
* Heterogeneous Array
* Jagged Arrays
* Object Literal
* Object Constructor (Basic)
* Object Properties
* Object Methods
* "this" (in relation to Objects)
* Object Constructors (Advanced)
* Bringing it all together (Loops, Objects, and Arrays)

This week's homework is broken in to three parts. The first two are smaller reviews of arrays and objects. Part 3 will bring everything together into a more "business problem" based question. It will feel tough, but it should also feel closer to what it will be like in class or at a development job. Take your time with the problem and stretch what you know about JavaScript. Experiment as you work through the problem and we encourage you to rush to failure. Let us know where you get stuck, as always we are here to help.

### Week 4 Assignment
As always start off by forking and cloning this repository from Github. Open the code up in Atom to get started.

Don't forget to **keep the existing code as is** and ignore any code that is commented: `// -- DON'T TOUCH CODE BELOW --`. Also, remember `console.log()` is your friend and you can use it in conjunction with the browser console to see the output of your code as you go.

### Pt.1: Arrays
Inside the `assignment` folder you will find a file called `arrays.assignment.js`. Open that file and follow the instructions outlined in the JavaScript comments (denoted with //). For this assignment you are given function signatures and will be asked to finish the body of the function.

### Pt.2: Objects
Inside the `assignment` folder you will find a file called `objects.assignment.js`. Open that file and follow the instructions outlined in the JavaScript comments (denoted with //). For this assignment you are given function signatures and will be asked to finish the body of the function.

### Pt.3: Put it all together

You will find the problem description in this other markdown file: [bringItTogether.md](bringItTogether.md). Good luck!
