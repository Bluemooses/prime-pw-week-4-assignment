# Prework Week 4

Welcome to the week four homework assignment. You have learned a lot over this week, it's impressive. Take a look at the topics listed below and be proud of yourself!

## Topics Covered in Codecademy
* Array Review
* Multi-Dimensional Arrays
* Heterogeneous Arrays
* Jagged Arrays
* Object Literals
* Object Constructors (Basic)
* Object Properties
* Object Methods
* "this" (in relation to Objects)
* Object Constructors (Advanced)
* Bringing it all together (Loops, Objects, and Arrays)

This week's homework is broken into 3 parts: *Parts 1 & 2* are smaller reviews of arrays and objects. In *Part 3*, you'll bring everything together to solve a business problem.

With the business problem presented in Part 3, we will be a little closer to what it feels like to be in class or on the job as a developer. This type of problem will feel tough, so take your time with the problem and stretch what you know about JavaScript. Experiment as you work through the problem, we encourage you to rush to failure. Let us know where you get stuck because, as always, we are here to help.

### Week 4 Assignment
As always start off by forking and cloning this repository from Github. Open the code in Atom to get started.

**IMPORTANT:** Don't forget to _keep the existing code as is_ and ignore any code that is commented: `// -- DON'T TOUCH CODE BELOW --`.

Finally, remember `console.log()` is your friend and you can use it in conjunction with the browser console to see the output of your code as you go.

### Part 1: Arrays
Inside the `assignment` folder you will find a file called `arrays.assignment.js`. Open that file and follow the instructions outlined in the JavaScript comments (denoted with `//`). For this assignment you are given function signatures and will be asked to code the body of the function.

### Part 2: Objects
Inside the `assignment` folder you will find a file called `objects.assignment.js`. Open that file and follow the instructions outlined in the JavaScript comments (denoted with `//`). For this assignment you are given function signatures and will be asked to code the body of the function.

### Part 3: Put it all together

You will find the problem description in a separate markdown file: [bringItTogether.md](bringItTogether.md). Good luck!
